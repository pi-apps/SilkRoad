# Video and Live Streaming Functionality

The video package contains functions for working with video and audio data, such as functions for encoding and decoding video streams, or for adjusting video and audio settings. The live_stream package contains functions for setting up and managing live streams, allowing sellers to broadcast video content to multiple customers at once.

## Video Package

### VideoEncoder

The VideoEncoder class allows you to encode video frames into a video file. Here's an example of how to use it: [Video Encoder](example/video_encoder.py)

### VideoDecoder

The VideoDecoder class allows you to decode video frames from a video file. Here's an example of how to use it: [Video Decoder](example/video_decoder.py)

### AudioEncoder

The AudioEncoder class allows you to encode audio frames into an audio file. Here's an example of how to use it: [Audio Encoder](example/audio_encoder.py)

### AudioDecoder

The AudioDecoder class allows you to decode audio frames from an audio file. Here's an example of how to use it: [Audio Decoder](example/audio_decoder.py)

### adjust_video_settings

The adjust_video_settings function allows you to adjust the video settings, such as changing the video codec or the bitrate. Here's an example of how to use it: [Adjust Video Settings](example/adjust_video_settings.py)

### adjust_audio_settings

The adjust_audio_settings function allows you to adjust the audio settings, such as changing the audio codec or the bitrate. Here's an example of how to use it: [Adjust Audio Settings](example/adjust_audio_settings.py) 

### Live Stream Package

#### LiveStream

The LiveStream class allows you to set up and manage live streams, allowing sellers to broadcast video content to multiple customers at once. Here's an example of how to use it: [Live Stream](example/live_stream.py)

These are just examples of how to use the video and live streaming functionality. You can modify the code to suit your specific use case and requirements.

Please note that this implementation is a basic version, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, this code only works with OpenCV and may not be compatible with other video and audio processing libraries. Make sure to test the functionality thoroughly before using it in a production environment.
